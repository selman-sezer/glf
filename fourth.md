# TokenBucket

This project implements a **Token Bucket** algorithm for rate-limiting. The token bucket is a simple mechanism to control how many actions (e.g., API requests) can be performed over a given time window. The bucket accumulates tokens at a steady rate which you can fine-tune and stop it for a duration, and each action consumes a token. If no tokens are available, the action can either fail or wait for tokens to refill.

## Features
- **Asynchronous Consumption**: Supports waiting for tokens asynchronously when they are unavailable.
- **Customizable Refill Rates**: Allows fine-tuning of bucket capacity, refill rate, and time windows.
- **Force Stop and Refill**: Can force a bucket to wait and stop refilling for a specified duration.
- **Verbose Mode**: Logs the state of the token bucket for debugging purposes.


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js**: Ensure that you have Node.js installed on your machine.
- **TypeScript**: This project uses TypeScript for type safety. You should have `tsc` installed, or use the provided compiled JavaScript if applicable.

## Usage

### Get Started

```typescript
import { TokenBucket } from 'token-bucket';

const tokenBucket = new TokenBucket({
  capacity: 10,
  fillPerWindow: 1,
  windowInMs: 1000,
});

if (tokenBucket.consume()) {
  // Your logic when a token is consumed successfully
}
```

### Usage with Verbose Logging

```typescript
import { TokenBucket } from 'token-bucket';

const tokenBucket = new TokenBucket({
  capacity: 20,
  fillPerWindow: 5,
  windowInMs: 2000,
}, true);

async function makeRequest() {
  if (await tokenBucket.consumeAsync()) {
    // Your async logic when a token is consumed successfully
  } else {
    console.log("Rate limit exceeded. Waiting for tokens...");
  }
}

makeRequest();
```

### Wait for enough Tokens to be in a Tokenbucket

```typescript
import { TokenBucket } from 'token-bucket';

const tokenBucket = new TokenBucket({
  capacity: 20,
  fillPerWindow: 5,
  windowInMs: 2000,
}, true);

// This while loop waits for tokenBucket to asynchronously consumes the specified number of tokens.
let numberOfTokensToBeConsumed = 5;
while (!await tokenBucket.consumeAsync(numberOfTokensToBeConsumed));
```


## Configuration Options

### TokenBucketOptions

- **capacity**: The maximum number of tokens in the bucket.
- **fillPerWindow**: The number of tokens added to the bucket per window.
- **windowInMs**: The size of the window in milliseconds.
- **initialTokens**: The initial number of tokens in the bucket. Defaults to the capacity if not provided.

## Methods

### consume(amount: number = 1): boolean

Consumes the specified number of tokens from the bucket. Returns `true` if the tokens were successfully consumed, otherwise `false`.

### consumeAsync(amount: number = 1): Promise<boolean>

Asynchronously consumes the specified number of tokens from the bucket. Returns a promise that resolves to `true` if the tokens were successfully consumed, otherwise `false`.

### start(): TokenBucket

Starts the internal timer for refilling tokens. Returns the `TokenBucket` instance to allow chaining.

### stop(): void

Stops the internal timer for refilling tokens.

### forceWaitUntilMilisecondsPassed(delayInMs: number): void

Forces the bucket to wait until the specified amount of milliseconds have passed before refilling.
